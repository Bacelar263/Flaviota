I love venturing into new learning, so every day I want to discover something new in the mobile universe. I am an advocate of open source projects, passionate about technology of all kinds and passionate about my ongoing studies.

In the mobile universe, I develop for **Mobile** with solid knowledge in **Kotlin** and **Java** because I love the performance of native development. Still, in the future, I will try out the universe of **React Native** as hybrid languages.

Creativity is something I love to explore and to expand that a bit further, I learn about **JavaScript** and its offshoots.
Soon I want to put here all my lovely projects and my ideas.
There are many skills that I want to show and teachâ€¦
